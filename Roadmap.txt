Concepts and Features :
- lvalue/rvalue/xvalue
- move concepts (move constructor for ex? T&& related?)
- "for_each" usage (seems different in c++?)
- Parameter pack practice

Short-term objectives :
- Practice with STL Containers and Iterators for good so I can try to make
my own implementations
- Experiment stuff read/learnt
- Make a use of this stuff in ThisWeirdConsoleGame / test projects to practice

Medium-term objectives :
- Make ThisWeirdConsoleGame playable and achievable.

Long-term objectives :
- Refactor ThisWeirdConsoleGame with as many features from C++ as possible
and optimizations
- Get better at maths / physics (might take online courses)

Long-long-term objectives : 
- Low-level SWE (AI, Security, VideoGames)
- Complete projects using Vulkan/D3D/OpenGL
- Complete projects using media frameworks/libraries (Qt/SFML/SDL,Ogre3D...)
- Take a shot with game engines (Unreal, Unity, Godot...)

Constant-term objectives :
- Have fun while programming.
- Exercise DSA / new features frequently, read others' code, contribute to projects
- Don't precipitate when reading content
- Just write more code. Don't always strive to know every little detail 
and master everything perfectly, it is a form of procrastination. 
- Don't explain the "what" in comments. Explain the "why".
