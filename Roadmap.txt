Concepts and Features :
- Callback Functions
- Lambdas
- "Bitwise" operations and stuff
- Variadic Templates (class/function)
- Perfect Forwarding

Short-term objectives :
- Implement more containers from STL (list, tree, stack...)
- Complete chapter M (Move Semantics and Smart Pointers) from Learncpp.com 
- Practice Win32 API (XInput because ITS FUUUUUUN)
- Read code everyday / answer questions if you don't code
- Experiment stuff that you have interest for in the first place

Medium-term objectives :
- Make ThisWeirdConsoleGame playable and achievable.

Long-term objectives :
- Refactor ThisWeirdConsoleGame with as many features from C++ as possible 
and optimizations
- Get better at maths / physics (might take online courses)

Long-long-term objectives : 
- Low-level SWE (AI, Security, VideoGames)
- Complete projects using Vulkan/D3D/OpenGL
- Complete projects using media frameworks/libraries (Qt/SFML/SDL,Ogre3D...)
- Take a shot with game engines (Unreal, Unity, Godot...)
- Be at ease with web development
- Be at ease with networking

Constant-term objectives :
- Exercise DSA / new features frequently, read code, contribute to projects, answer
questions
- Don't precipitate when reading content, even if there is boiler plate.
- Just write more code. Don't always strive to know every little detail 
and master everything perfectly, it is a form of procrastination.
- Take breaks, you can't always want to code. But it could be a mindset issue or
an external factor that you should fix.
