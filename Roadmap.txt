Constant-term objectives :
- HAVE FUN AND DO YOUR BEST WHILE GRINDING. DON'T TRY TO CODE PERFECTLY, JUST DO MORE.
- Exercise DSA / new features frequently, read other's code, contribute to projects, stackoverflow.com...
- Don't precipitate when reading content
- You have the capability to write code at any given time. Don't always strive to know every little detail 
and master everything perfectly, it is a form of procrastination. Be humble and take your time to learn.
- Take the time required to learn/code, be ready to do it (meditation ?)
