// Everything is listed in descending priority order
(from the most to the less important/relevant)

Other Backlog :
- Unicode, UTF Encoding, String/Char Literals Types

Concepts and Features :
- Templates
- In-depth Enums
- Type_traits, allocators ?

Short-term objectives :
- Experiment stuff read on the internet in LearnCPP
- Make a use of this stuff in ThisWeirdConsoleGame 

Medium-term objectives :
- Templates mastery

Long-term objectives :
- Complete ThisWeirdConsoleGame's project with as many features from C++ as possible
- Get better at maths / physics (might take online courses)

Long-long-term objectives : 
- Low-level SWE (AI, Security, VideoGames)
- Complete projects using Vulkan/D3D/OpenGL
- Complete projects using media frameworks/libraries (Qt/SFML/SDL,Ogre3D...)
- Take a shot with game engines (Unreal, Unity, Godot...)

Constant-term objectives :
- Have fun while programming.
- Exercise DSA / new features frequently, read others' code, contribute to projects
- Don't precipitate when reading content
- Just write more code. Don't always strive to know every little detail 
and master everything perfectly, it is a form of procrastination.
