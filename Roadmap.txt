Concepts and Features :
- move semantics (move constructor for ex?)

Short-term objectives :
- Experiment stuff read/learnt
- Make a use of this stuff in ThisWeirdConsoleGame / test projects to practice

Medium-term objectives :
- Make ThisWeirdConsoleGame playable and achievable.

Long-term objectives :
- Refactor ThisWeirdConsoleGame with as many features from C++ as possible 
and optimizations
- Get better at maths / physics (might take online courses)

Long-long-term objectives : 
- Low-level SWE (AI, Security, VideoGames)
- Complete projects using Vulkan/D3D/OpenGL
- Complete projects using media frameworks/libraries (Qt/SFML/SDL,Ogre3D...)
- Take a shot with game engines (Unreal, Unity, Godot...)

Constant-term objectives :
- Have fun while programming.
- Exercise DSA / new features frequently, read others' code, contribute to projects
- Don't precipitate when reading content, even if there is boiler plate.
- Just write more code. Don't always strive to know every little detail 
and master everything perfectly, it is a form of procrastination.
- Take breaks. Sometimes you really don't want to code. That's normal, but it
can be a mindset issue or an external factor that you have to fix.
- Don't explain the "what" in comments. Explain the "why".
